# X# Kompendium - the examples
==============================

This repo contains the examples for my book "X# Kompendium".

You will find the book in the *MkDocs* format here:

[https://nanobooks23.de](https://nanobooks23.de)

The repo also contains the examples for the "bonus chapters" which are not part of the *MkDocs* site.

The complete book can be purchased (for a small amount) at a later time as as Pdf file (more on this later).
